In order to use Plutus Testing Tool, you need to:
1. It is assumed that the DApp uses Nix flakes.
2. The DApp needs to depend on [plutus-apps](https://github.com/input-output-hk/plutus-apps/).
3. The DApp needs to use a version of plutus-apps compatible with the `plutus-contract-certification` project from the v1.2.0 [release](https://github.com/input-output-hk/plutus-apps/tree/v1.2.0/plutus-contract-certification) of `plutus-apps`.
