# Certificates that can be generated by the tool

As of today, the Certification Working Group has yet to define the Certification levels 1, 2, 3. As a consequence, it is advised to only use the tool for Level 0 certificates, which are a way of publishing audit report, testing campaign, that do not meet the requirements for a certification level. [ref when we have it]

Our testing tool will automatically generate the CIP-0096-compliant [link to CIP-0096]on-chain and off-chain metadata for a certificate. Users are free to broadcast them themselves as metadata on a transaction [ref to how to do it].

As a subscriber to an Auditor level, you will have the possibility to format your data as a CIP-0096 compliant certificate. [Screenshot to where to click?]. The form will let you pick between level 0 (no standard) and level 2 (manual audit). We recommend you only broadcast level 0 certificates at the moment as the Certification standard level 2 has yet to be defined.
